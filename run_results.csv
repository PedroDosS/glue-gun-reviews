I've had a high temperature commercial type gun for many year that finally died. I'm too old to do a lot of stuff I used to do and don't need that grade of glue gun now. This is a small unit. It fit's in the palm of my hand. It's simple, works easily, heats up fast and flows nicely. Just don't expect it to fix furniture, heavy things, or those under mechanical stress. This is a crafter's glue gun. It is plastic so I won't expect the durability to last as long as my previous one.

I thought, for $4.21 there's no way this thing will even melt glue sticks let alone be a usable and functional hot glue gun.
Boy was I wrong.
I bought this as a backup to keep in the packaging for that one day when my main glue gun died on me.
I've had this now for about a month and it has gotten more use than my regular full size hot glue gun.
I've timed it a few times and it's a bit slower but it'll heat up to a useable temp in about 2 minutes and full heat in about 2:20-2:30, which in my mind is pretty quick. The glue comes out clear and at a steady rate.
The mini sticks go fast so I'd recommend looking for the 8"" ones so you're not constantly feeding them as you use it. That said the forward feed mechanism on this works great, and the trigger mechanism has a good amount of resistance to it. It does not drip like many less-expensive glue guns, and so far I've put about 25-30 glue sticks through it in the last month without issue.
I purchased the Hi-Temp version and am very happy with it - in the future I may try out the low temp version if it is available at the same price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4DH6PQGCLMZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01FIJPPN4

I'm starting out in wreath making and it's great for someone who's just starting out in crafts, or someone who only needs to use one every once in a while. Even though I like it, I'm gonna be buying a full sized glue gun. The main reason is because the glue sticks run out way too fast for me. I used over half the sticks included making one mini wreath (in photo). It gets the job done I'm just gonna need one that doesn't run out of glue so quickly. I found myself messing up a few times because I didn't expect it to run out mid-stream.
Anyways I don't know how inevitable the stringing is but no matter what technique I tried there was so much stringing!!! I collected them all up at the end and I'm pretty sure it wasted a full stick of string. Like I said, I don't know if that's with every glue gun but I was annoyed.
Other than those two issues (which are only annoyances) this is a neat little glue gun! It gets really hot and I like that because sometimes I needed to cover a lot of surface and it didn't dry or cool too fast. If you are working with plastic it will melt thin plastic. I did burn my finger a couple times. It has a squeaky trigger but I don't mind. For the money it's really not junky and it gets the job done!
All I'd say is if you find you're gonna use it frequently I'd buy a full size glue gun cause the glue lasts longer. You can find full sizes for super cheap as well, just keep scrolling... It's gonna be my nice little back up glue gun and I do not regret buying it.

It only comes with 10 mini glue sticks so you might want to buy a package of the mini glue sticks to keep around.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVUTNUDF05IHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01FIJPPN4

My first job was an accent wall, inspired by a YouTuber. I looked for YouTube videos that advertised recommended glue guns, unsuccessfully. I eventually just settled for reading reviews to find one that worked good.
This glue gun is my first one ever, so I really have nothing to compare it to, but it works as intended.
It is very easy to use! It warms up in a few minutes and does not drip glue excessively, while sitting idle. It is rather small, but is sufficient for small projects.
On the downside, I paid a little over $6 for this, which included 10 glue sticks. I went to Walmart about a week later for other items, and just happened to go to the section where they have these. This exact item (gun only) was only $2.67, and I purchased a 100 pack of glue sticks @ about $6.28.
Definitely cheaper to purchase at Walmart, and had I not already used the glue sticks, I would have returned it.
I will say that for larger products, you might want to get a bigger glue gun, that takes bigger glue sticks, as the 10 that came with this was gone in like 5 minutes üòÇ.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R302JJRBAKYD3L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01FIJPPN4
