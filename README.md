# Glue Gun Reviews

This was a project for my Engineering 101 class. The goal was to perform data mining in order to
discover ways to improve a common household product: a hot glue gun. In order to perform the analysis,
I first webscraped reviews from online retailer websites, such as Amazom.com and Walmart.com. Using the
semantic anaylsis features in the Orange Text Mining tool, I was able to construct positive and negative
word clouds and plots to gain insight as to what aspects of the product customers liked and disliked. 
Using this information, I was able to propose possible changes to improve the product.
